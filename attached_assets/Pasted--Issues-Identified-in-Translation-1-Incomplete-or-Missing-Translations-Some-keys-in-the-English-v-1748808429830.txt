 Issues Identified in Translation
1. Incomplete or Missing Translations
Some keys in the English version lack proper translation:

json


1
2
3
4
5
// Polish (complete)
"custom_sizing": "Wymiary Niestandardowe"

// English (incomplete)
"custom_sizing": "Custom Sick"
Clearly a machine translation error ("Sick" instead of "Sizing"). 

Another example:

json


1
2
3
4
5
// Polish
"bulk_pricing_desc": "Rabaty hurtowe przy zakupie wielu kontener√≥w"

// English
"bulk_pricing_desc": "Volume Discounts for Multiple Containers"
‚úÖ Correct

But:

json


1
2
3
4
5
// Polish
"custom_sizing_desc": "Projektowanie kontener√≥w wed≈Çug dok≈Çadnych specyfikacji"

// English
"custom_sizing_desc": "Design Containers with Exact Specifications"
‚úÖ Also correct

However, many technical terms are either missing or partially translated.

2. Grammar and Syntax Errors
Some strings have poor grammar or syntax issues:

json


1
2
3
"employee_tools": "Employee Tools",
"ai_cost_estimation": "AI Cost Estimation",
"ai_powered_estimation": "AI-powered container modification cost estimation",
‚úÖ These are acceptable.

But:

json


1
"delivery_zone_international": "International (outside Europe)"
‚ö†Ô∏è Should be:

json


1
"delivery_zone_international": "International (Outside Europe)"
Capitalization mismatch.

Also:

json


1
"exterior_cladding_composite": "Composite material (specialist)"
Could be improved to:

json


1
"exterior_cladding_composite": "Composite Material (Specialist Use)"
3. Inconsistent Capitalization
Some entries use inconsistent capitalization:

json


1
2
"employee_tools": "Employee Tools", // Proper case
"security_systems_advanced": "Advanced safety systems", // Lowercase after colon
Better:

json


1
"security_systems_advanced": "Advanced Safety Systems"
4. Missing Keys in English Version
There are several keys that exist in the Polish file but are missing in the English one :
For example:

json


1
2
3
4
5
// In Polish file
"technical_analysis": "Analiza Techniczna",
"quote_generator": "Generator Ofert",

// Not found in English
This can cause runtime errors or fallback issues if not handled properly.

5. Mismatched Enum Values
Some enum values don‚Äôt match in number or meaning between languages:

json


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
‚åÑ
‚åÑ
// Polish
"flooring": {
  "plywood": "Sklejka",
  "vinyl": "Winyl",
  "carpet": "Wyk≈Çadzina",
  "hardwood": "Drewno",
  "polished_concrete": "Polerowany beton"
}

// English
"flooring": {
  "none": "Without a floor (corrugated sheet)",
  "plywood": "Waterproof plywood 18mm (standard)",
  ...
}
The English version adds descriptions and extra values , while the Polish version sticks strictly to basic types.

üß© Recommendations
Translation Errors
Review all machine-translated strings by native speakers or professional translators.
Missing Keys
Ensure all keys from base language (Polish) are present in target language (English).
Inconsistencies
Standardize capitalization, punctuation, and formatting across all strings.
Technical Terms
Use domain-specific terminology (e.g., HVAC, insulation levels, electrical units) correctly.
Validation Tooling
Implement a validation script to ensure all keys are present and consistent across language files.
