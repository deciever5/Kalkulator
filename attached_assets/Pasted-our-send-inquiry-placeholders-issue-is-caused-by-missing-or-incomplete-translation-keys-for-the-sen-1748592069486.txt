our send inquiry placeholders issue is caused by missing or incomplete translation keys for the "send_inquiry" section in some languages. Here’s how to fix it:

What’s wrong?
The Polish (pl.json), English (en.json), German (de.json), Dutch (nl.json), Czech (cs.json), and Hungarian (hu.json) files do have a send_inquiry section.
However, many non-Polish files are missing keys or entire sub-entries that are present in the Polish file.
Your form likely uses keys like send_inquiry.description, send_inquiry.full_name, etc., which are not present or are incomplete in these other language files—so placeholders display instead.
How to fix
You need to copy all keys and structure from the Polish (pl.json) send_inquiry section to every other language file, and translate the values.
If you don’t provide translations, at least use the Polish or English text as a placeholder so the fields will appear.

Example: Add/complete this structure in every file:
