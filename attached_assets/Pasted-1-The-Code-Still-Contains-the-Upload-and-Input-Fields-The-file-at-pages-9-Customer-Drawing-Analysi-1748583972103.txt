1. The Code Still Contains the Upload and Input Fields
The file at pages/9_Customer_Drawing_Analysis.py does include the following UI elements:
st.file_uploader() for user file upload (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, allows multiple files).
st.text_input() for project name and location.
These fields are not removed from the code.
2. Recent Changes and Potential Issues
Recent commits (today, and yesterday) have changed this file and translation files. The commit messages mention:

Fixing file upload functionality and translations
Fixing JSON syntax errors in locales/en.json
Adding missing translation keys for "drawing_analysis_customer" in multiple languages
This suggests that:

If there is a translation key missing, the label for your fields (e.g., the text for the upload box or text inputs) might be missing or cause errors, depending on how your translation function handles missing keys.
3. Potential Causes for the UI Not Rendering Properly
Missing or Broken Translations: If a translation key like drawing_analysis_customer.upload_drawings or drawing_analysis_customer.file_upload is missing or broken in the selected locale, Streamlit might display a blank label or even error out, causing the UI to appear empty or incomplete.
Error in Translation File: If any of the locales/*.json files are not valid JSON (missing commas, stray characters), this can break the translation loader and prevent the page from rendering beyond the error point.
Condition Blocking Fields: The code only displays the UI if 'container_config' exists in st.session_state. If it’s missing, the upload/input fields never render and you see only a warning with two navigation buttons.
4. What You Should Check/Fix
Check Your locales/*.json Files: Look for syntax errors, and ensure all drawing_analysis_customer keys exist for all languages. A single broken JSON file or missing key can break the translation and page rendering.
Check That container_config Is Set: Open the configurator first and ensure a container is configured before visiting the drawing analysis page.
Check for Errors in the App: If an error occurs during translation loading, Streamlit may skip rendering some components or fail silently if you don’t have error reporting enabled.
