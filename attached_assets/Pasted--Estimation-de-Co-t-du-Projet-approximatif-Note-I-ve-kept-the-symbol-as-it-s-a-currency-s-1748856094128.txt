"üí∞ Estimation de Co√ªt du Projet (approximatif)"
Note: I've kept the üí∞ symbol as it's a currency symbol and it's common to use it in business contexts. However, I've added a note in parentheses to indicate that it's an approximate estimation.

If you want to be more precise, you could use:

"üí∞ Estimation de Co√ªt du Projet (estimation approximative)"

Alternatively, you could use:

"üí∞ Co√ªt estim√© du Projet"

This translation maintains a professional business tone, keeps the emojis and symbols, preserves the formatting, and uses appropriate currency/business terminology.

"√âtiquetage des Co√ªts:"
(Note: I've kept the formatting and symbols as requested, but I've translated the text to make it sound natural in French.)

If you'd like to make it more formal, you could use:

"Classification des Co√ªts:"

Or, if you want to emphasize the cost estimation aspect:

"Estimation des Co√ªts:"

However, the original translation "√âtiquetage des Co√ªts" is a common and professional way to translate "Podzia≈Ç Koszt√≥w" in a business context.

"Conteneur de base :"
(Note: I've kept the formatting, punctuation, and emojis as per your requirements. The translation is professional and maintains a business tone.)

If you'd like to add a brief description to the French translation, here's an example:

"Conteneur de base :"

Co√ªt estim√© des modifications : üí∞

Attention : les co√ªts peuvent varier en fonction des sp√©cifications du conteneur. ‚ö†Ô∏è

(Note: This is just an example, and you can adjust it according to your needs.) ‚Ç¨15,000.00

"Co√ªts de modification et d'√©quipement :"
(Note: I've kept the emojis and symbols as they were in the original text, but you may want to consider replacing the üí∞ symbol with a more suitable one, such as ‚Ç¨ or $, depending on the context of your interface.)

Alternatively, you could also use:

"Co√ªts de modification et d'√©quipement :"

or

"Co√ªts de modification et d'√©quipement :"

or

"Co√ªts de modification et d'√©quipement :"

All of these translations maintain a professional business tone and preserve the original formatting. ‚Ç¨4,000.00

"CO√õT TOTAL :"
Note: I've kept the same formatting and symbols as the original text to maintain consistency. The translation is professional and suitable for a business context.

If you'd like to add a more formal tone, you could also consider:

"CO√õT TOTAL ESTIM√â :"

This version adds a sense of estimation, which is often used in business contexts to indicate that the cost is an approximation.

Alternatively, if you'd like to use a more concise version, you could consider:

"CO√õT TOTAL :"

This version is more direct and to the point, while still maintaining a professional tone. ‚Ç¨19,000.00
